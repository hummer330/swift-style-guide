# Swift Style Guide

This is a working document that proposes a style guide for Apple's recently-announced [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) language. Feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/jamieforrest/swift-style-guide/issues), or [pull requests](https://github.com/jamieforrest/swift-style-guide/pulls).

## Sources

The style guide is based on the [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097) book, as well as the *Introduction to Swift*, *Intermediate Swift*, and *Advanced Swift* sessions from [WWDC 2014](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/)

## Constants and Variables

Use `let` over `var` where possible to avoid mutable state where it isn't necessary.
